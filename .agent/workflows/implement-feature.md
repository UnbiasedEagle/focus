description: Implement a new feature or fix a bug following the PR workflow
---

1.  **Create a Branch**:

    - Always start by checking out a new branch.
    - Naming convention: `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
    - Do NOT commit directly to `main`.
    - Example: `git checkout -b feature/user-profile-page`

2.  **Implementation**:

    - Make the necessary code changes.
    - Verify the changes (run tests, linters, etc.).

3.  **Push Changes**:

    - Push the branch to origin.
    - Example: `git push origin feature/user-profile-page`

4.  **Notify User**:
    - Inform the user that the code is pushed.
    - Remind them to create the Pull Request and enable Auto-Merge.
